这个项目全名为：基于静态页面的文件存储系统 Static Page Based File Storage System

Tip: because the author is a Chinese people and doesn't say English very well, the content of the English part is translated by Baidu, so there may be grammatical errors and other problems in the English part. Please forgive me. If you know Chinese, you'd better read Chinese!
